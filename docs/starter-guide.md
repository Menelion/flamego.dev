# Starter guide

::: warning
This guide is not intended to teach you how to use [Go](https://golang.org), and would assume you already have basic knowledge about HTTP, web applications development and programming in Go.
:::

Let's start with the minimal example you may have seen on the front page:

```go
package main

import "github.com/flamego/flamego"

func main() {
	f := flamego.Classic()
	f.Get("/", func() string {
		return "Hello, Flamego!"
	})
	f.Run()
}
```

On line 6, the function [`flamego.Classic`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flamego/flamego#Classic) creates and returns a [classic Flame instance](core-concepts.md#classic-flame) with a default list of middleware, including [`flamego.Logger`](core-services.md#routing-logger), [`flamego.Recovery`](core-services.md#panic-recovery) and [`flamego.Static`](core-services.md#serving-static-files).

On line 7, the method [`f.Get`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flamego/flamego#Router) registers the anonymous function (from line 7 to 9) to be the [handler](core-concepts.md#handlers) of the root path ("/") when a HTTP GET request comes in. In this case, the handler simply reponds a "Hello, Flamego!" string to the client.

On line 10, we start the web server by calling [`f.Run`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flamego/flamego#Flame.Run). By default, the [Flame instance](core-concepts.md#instances) listens on the address `0.0.0.0:2830`.

Alright, now save the file and initialize a [Go module](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules#:~:text=A%20module%20is%20a%20collection,needed%20for%20a%20successful%20build.):

```:no-line-numbers
$ mkdir flamego-example
$ cd flamego-example
$ nano main.go

$ go mod init flamego-example
go: creating new go.mod: module flamego-example
$ go mod tidy
go: finding module for package github.com/flamego/flamego
...

$ go run main.go
[Flamego] Listening on 0.0.0.0:2830 (development)
```

Once you see the last line from your terminal, you're good to go!

You may verify the result by either visiting [http://localhost:2830](http://localhost:2830) ([why 2830?](faqs.md#why-the-default-port-is-2830)) in your browser, or through the folllowing `curl` command:

```:no-line-numbers
$ curl http://localhost:2830
Hello, Flamego!
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡ Did you know?
If you have used other Go web frameworks like [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) or [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/), you may be surpised that you can directly return a string in Flamego handlers as the response body to the client.

That is exactly right! Of course, this won't be the only way to make a response body (which would be a very unfriendly design!). If you're interested in reading more, the [return values](core-concepts.md#return-values) is the magician behind the scene.
:::

## Unfolding hidden parts

The minimal example aims for the least lines of code for a functioning example, but it inevitably hides some interesting details. Therefore, we're going to unfold those hidden parts to understand more about how things are assembled.

Let's first modify our `main.go` file as follows:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/flamego/flamego"
)

func main() {
	f := flamego.Classic()
	f.Get("/{*}", printRequestPath)

	log.Println("Server is running...")
	log.Println(http.ListenAndServe("0.0.0.0:2830", f))
}

func printRequestPath(c flamego.Context) string {
	return "The request path is: " + c.Request().RequestURI
}
```

As you may have guessed, this program responds back the request path that the client is requesting.

Take a look!

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="Run">

```:no-line-numbers
$ go run main.go
2021/11/18 14:00:03 Server is running...
```

  </CodeGroupItem>

  <CodeGroupItem title="Test" active>

```:no-line-numbers
$ curl http://localhost:2830
The request path is: /

$ curl http://localhost:2830/hello-world
The request path is: /hello-world

$curl http://localhost:2830/never-mind
The request path is: /never-mind

$ curl http://localhost:2830/bad-ass/who-am-i
404 page not found
```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

So what are different now?

On line 11, we're still using the `flamego.Classic` to give us a classic Flame instance.

On line 12, insetad of using an anonymous function, function `printRequestPath` is registered as the handler for all of the HTTP GET requests under root path ("/") using the notation `{*}`. The routing match stops at the slash ("/") as you can tell from the last test request to "http://localhost:2830/bad-ass/who-am-i" that gives us 404.

::: tip
Try using the notation `{**: **}`, then redo all test requests and see what changes. If you're interested in reading more, the [routing](routing.md) has the best resources you would want.
:::

On line 15, the call of `f.Run` is replaced by the [`http.ListenAndServe`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ListenAndServe), which is the most common way to start a web server in Go, and maybe more familiar to you if you have used other Go web frameworks. This is possible with Flamego because Flame instances implement the [`http.Handler`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Handler) interface. Therefore, a Flame instance can be plugged into anywhere that accepts a `http.Handler`, and is particularly useful when you want to progressively migrate an existing Go web application to use Flamego.
