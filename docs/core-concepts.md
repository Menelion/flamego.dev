# Core concepts

This page describes foundational concepts that are required to be proficient of using Flamego to build web applications that are most optimal.

## Classic Flame

The classic Flame instance is the one that comes with a reasonable list of default middleware and could be your starting point for build web applications using Flamego.

A fresh classic Flame instance is returned every time you call [`flamego.Classic`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flamego/flamego#Classic), and following middleware are registered automatically:

- [`flamego.Logger`](core-services.md#routing-logger) for logging requested routes
- [`flamego.Recovery`](core-services.md#panic-recovery) for recovering from panic
- [`flamego.Static`](core-services.md#serving-static-files) for serving static files

::: tip
If you look up [the source code of the `flamego.Classic`](https://github.com/flamego/flamego/blob/8505d18c5243f797d5bb7160797d26454b9e5011/flame.go#L65-L77), it is fairly simple:

```go:no-line-numbers
func Classic() *Flame {
	f := New()
	f.Use(
		Logger(),
		Recovery(),
		Static(
			StaticOptions{
				Directory: "public",
			},
		),
	)
	return f
}
```

Do keep in mind that `flamego.Classic` may not always be what you want if you do not use these default middleware (e.g. for using custom implementations), or to use different config options, or even just want to change the order of middleware as sometimes the order matters (i.e. middleware are being invoked in the same order as they are registered).
:::

## Instances

The function [`flamego.New`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flamego/flamego#New) is used to create bare Flame instances that do not have default middleware registered, and any type that contains the [`flamego.Flame`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flamego/flamego#Flame) can be seen as a Flame instance.

Each Flame instace is independent of other Flame instances in the sense that instance state is not shared and is maintained separately by each of them. For example, you can have two Flame instances simultaneously and both of them can have different middleware, routes and handlers registered or defined:

```go:no-line-numbers
func main() {
	f1 := flamego.Classic()

	f2 := flamego.New()
	f2.Use(flamego.Recovery())

    ...
}
```

In the above example, `f1` has some default middleware registered as a classic Flame instance, while `f2` only has a single middleware `flamego.Recovery`.

::: tip ðŸ’¬ Do you agree?
Storing states in the way that is polluting global namespace is such a bad practice that not only makes the code hard to maintain in the future, but also creates more tech debt with every single new line of the code.

It feels so elegent to have isolated state managed by each Flame instance, and make it possible to migrate existing web applications to use Flamego progressively.

## Handlers

Flamego handlers are defined as [`flamego.Hander`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flamego/flamego#Handler), and if you look closer, it is just an empty interface (`interface{}`):

```go:no-line-numbers
// Handler is any callable function. Flamego attempts to inject services into
// the Handler's argument list and panics if any argument could not be fulfilled
// via dependency injection.
type Handler interface{}
```

As being noted in the docstring, any callable function is a valid `flamego.Handler`, doesn't matter if it's an anonymous, a declared function or even a method of a type:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Code
```go:no-line-numbers
package main

import (
	"github.com/flamego/flamego"
)

func main() {
	f := flamego.New()
	f.Get("/anonymous", func() string {
		return "Respond from an anonymous function"
	})
	f.Get("/declared", declared)

	t := &customType{}
	f.Get("/method", t.handler)

	f.Run()
}

func declared() string {
	return "Respond from a declared function"
}

type customType struct{}

func (t *customType) handler() string {
	return "Respond from a method of a type"
}
```
:::
::: code-group-item Test
```:no-line-numbers
$ curl http://localhost:2830/anonymous
Respond from an anonymous function

$ curl http://localhost:2830/declared
Respond from a declared function

$ curl http://localhost:2830/method
Respond from a method of a type
```
:::

## Return values

Generally, your web application needs to write content directly to the [`http.ResponseWriter`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ResponseWriter) (which you can retrieve using `ResponseWriter` method of [`flamego.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flamego/flamego#Context)). In some web frameworks, they offer returning an extra `error` as the indication of the server error as follows:

```go:no-line-numbers
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) error
```

However, you are still being limited to a designated list of return values from your handlers. In contrast, Flamego provides the flexibility of having different lists of return values from handlers based on your needs case by case, whether it's an error, a string, or just a status code.

Let's see some examples that you can use for your handlers:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Code
```go
package main

import (
	"errors"

	"github.com/flamego/flamego"
)

func main() {
	f := flamego.New()
	f.Get("/string", func() string {
		return "Return a string"
	})
	f.Get("/bytes", func() []byte {
		return []byte("Return some bytes")
	})
	f.Get("/error", func() error {
		return errors.New("Return an error")
	})
	f.Run()
}
```
:::
::: code-group-item Test
```:no-line-numbers
$ curl -i http://localhost:2830/string
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Return a string

$ curl -i http://localhost:2830/bytes
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Return some bytes

$ curl -i http://localhost:2830/error
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
...

Return an error
...
```
:::
::::

As you can see, if an error is returned, the Flame instance automatically sets the HTTP status code to be 500.

::: tip
Try returning `nil` for the error on line 18, then redo the test request and see what changes.
:::

In the cases that you want to have complete control over the status code of your handlers, that is also possible!

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Code
```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/flamego/flamego"
)

func main() {
	f := flamego.New()
	f.Get("/string", func() (int, string) {
		return http.StatusOK, "Return a string"
	})
	f.Get("/bytes", func() (int, []byte) {
		return http.StatusOK, []byte("Return some bytes")
	})
	f.Get("/error", func() (int, error) {
		return http.StatusForbidden, errors.New("Return an error")
	})
	f.Run()
}
```
:::
::: code-group-item Test
```:no-line-numbers
$ curl -i http://localhost:2830/string
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Return a string

$ curl -i http://localhost:2830/bytes
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Return some bytes

$ curl -i http://localhost:2830/error
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
...

Return an error
...
```
